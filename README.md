# Capstone Wellness App 

As a student, often times it can be difficult to be mindful of taking care of myself in the realm of sleep duration and water intake. This app allows me to track my water intake and sleep schedule, which helps increase my awareness of these things, just by visualizing it and actively inputting the data each day!
Another feature that I implemented into this app is the ability to self-assess productivity levels. With so many tasks throughout the day, it is crucial to plan productively because that will ultimately ensure that I maximize my time. Intellectually-heavy tasks should ideally be performed at times when my cognitive function is high, leaving menial tasks, like folding laundry and washing dishes, to be completed when I'm not as alert. 
Without tracking this information, however, it is impossible to be able to effectively plan for this. By including functionality for productivity logging, I am enabling myself to track and view this data, so I can plan to be productive!

This app was created with a Ruby on Rails backend!

## Installation

```bash
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

## Usage

```bash
rails server
```

You can test web requests as documented in the `requests.http` file.

## Roadmap

I would love to expand this to include better trackers of productivity/cognitive function!
